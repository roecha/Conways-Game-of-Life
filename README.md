# Conways-Game-of-Life
simple simulation of Conway's Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a zero player game where you set the initial board, click play, and see
what happens. Typically the rules are as follows: : a dead piece with three live pieces 
next to it will become alive, a live cell with two or three live neighbors stays alive, and all other live 
pieces die. This will cause the shapes of the pieces to evolve into endless different patterns.

I origionally created this project in python as part of a "art using math" project in Calculus.
I recreated it using HTML, CSS, and JS to improve some web development skills, and to experiment with 
different features. I plan to periodically touch up these files as my skills as a developer grow.
